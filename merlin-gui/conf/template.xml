	Workbench layout system customization
	This simple code tells the AIBench Workbench how to create its layout. It's like a table, where cells are separated by splitters. 
	You can edit this file to move or put put more slots with the <components> tag. Then you can put your custom components 
	(defined in your plugin.xml) in these slots.

<table>
	<row oneTouchExpandable="true" >
		<cell width="14%" oneTouchExpandable="true">
				<components id='left' hidetabs="false"/>
		</cell>
		<cell width="86%">
				<document_viewer />
		</cell>
	</row>
</table>
